# `who-can` - Find who can perform an action on a resource

```bash
iam-lens who-can [options]
```

Lists all principals in your IAM data who are allowed to perform one or more specified actions on a resource (or account for wildcard only actions). If applicable it will check the resource policy to find cross-account permissions and AWS service principals.

This works by starting with the resource policy (if any) and looking for all principals, accounts, and organizations that have access to the resource. It will then check each principal for the specified actions and return a list of all principals that are allowed to perform the action.

## Options

| Flag                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--resource <arn>`           | The ARN of the resource to check permissions for. Ignore for wildcard-only actions such as `iam:ListRoles`.                                                                                                            |
| `--resource-account <id>`    | The account ID of the resource, only required if it cannot be determined from the resource ARN. Required for wildcard actions such as `ec2:DescribeInstances`.                                                         |
| `--actions <service:action>` | One or more actions to check such as `s3:GetObject`. Specify as many actions as you want. If omitted it will analyze all valid actions for the resource. If no `--resource` is specified then actions must be entered. |

You can also include any [Global CLI Options](docs/GlobalCliOptions.md).

## Examples

```bash
# Who can get this object?
iam-lens who-can \
  --resource arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/secret-file.txt \
  --actions s3:GetObject

# Who can list all IAM roles in this account? (wildcard action â€“ no resource)
iam-lens who-can \
  --resource-account 555555555555 \
  --actions iam:ListRoles

# Check multiple actions at once
iam-lens who-can \
  --resource arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:555555555555:table/Books \
  --actions dynamodb:Query dynamodb:UpdateItem

# Check all actions for a bucket
iam-lens who-can \
  --resource arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket
```
